# Testing #

# TESTING SETUP
#
# This project is currently designed to parse ONE resume at a time.
#
# To test another resume, simply replace the file path below with the path of
# a different PDF or DOCX resume.
#
# Example:
# pdf_file = "resumes/resume2.pdf"
# pdf_file = "resumes/my_resume.docx"
#
#
# WHY IS THIS HARDCODED?
#
# During development, working with a single resume makes debugging much easier.
# If something goes wrong, we immediately know which file caused the issue.
#
#
# HOW WILL THIS WORK IN A REAL APPLICATION?
#
# Hardcoding file paths is NOT scalable.
#
# In a production application, resumes will not be specified manually.
# Instead, the program can be modified in one of the following ways:
#
# 1. User Upload
#    - User uploads a resume through a website or desktop application.
#    - The uploaded file is passed directly to read_resume().
#
# 2. Folder Processing (Batch Parsing)
#    - The program scans the "resumes/" folder automatically.
#    - It finds every PDF and DOCX file.
#    - Each resume is parsed one by one using a loop.
#
#      Example Flow:
#
#      resumes/
#      ├── resume1.pdf
#      ├── resume2.pdf
#      ├── resume3.docx
#      ├── resume4.pdf
#      └── ...
#
#      for file in resumes_folder:
#          text = read_resume(file)
#          parsed_resume = parse_resume(text)
#
#
# WHY IS THIS BETTER?
#
# Instead of changing the file path every time, the program automatically
# processes any number of resumes (10, 100, or even thousands) without
# modifying the source code.
#
#
# CURRENT STATUS
#
# ✅ Single Resume Parsing (Implemented)
# ⏳ Multiple Resume Parsing (Future Improvement)
# ⏳ Upload Resume Feature (Future Improvement)
# ⏳ Save Parsed Output to Database/JSON (Future Improvement)
